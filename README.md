# CalibCamera_ReDev
Calibration and localisation of a camera in 360°


This repository is used for a student project at École Centrale de Nantes.

The project consists of researching ways to automatically calibrate and localise a 360° camera in space.
If successful, it will be used in a pedestrian localisation project.
